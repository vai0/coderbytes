In this repo are solutions I've come up with for the Coderbyte challenges. All are done in Ruby, as it's sadly the only language I have a basic knowledge of using. Sometimes I'll have multiple solutions for each challenge, they'll all be in the same file with different method names.  

Feel free to contribute your solutions to the existing ones I currently have up!
